# Stochastic data

Decoupling data design and model design is a fundamental principle in StochasticPrograms. This decoupling is achieved through data injection. By data we mean parameters in an optimization problem. In StochasticPrograms, this data is either deterministic and related to a specific stage, or uncertain and related to a specific scenario.

## Stage data

Stage data is related to parameters that always appear in the first or second stage of a stochastic program. These parameters are deterministic and are the same across all scenarios. Stage data must be supplied when creating a stochastic program, through specialized constructors. However, the data can later be mutated without having to construct a new stochastic program instance. Any stage related data can then be accessed through the reserved keyword `stage` in [`@first_stage`](@ref) and [`@second_stage`](@ref) blocks. To showcase, we consider a minimal stochastic program:
```math
\DeclareMathOperator*{\maximize}{maximize}
\begin{aligned}
 \maximize_{x \in \mathbb{R}} & \quad x + \operatorname{\mathbb{E}}_{\omega} \left[Q(x, \xi(\omega))\right] \\
 \text{s.t.} & \quad l_1 \leq x \leq u_1
\end{aligned}
```
where
```math
\begin{aligned}
 Q(x, \xi(\omega)) = \max_{y \in \mathbb{R}} & \quad q_{\omega} y \\
 \text{s.t.} & \quad y + x \leq U \\
 & \quad l_2 \leq y \leq u_2
\end{aligned}
```
and the stochastic variable
```math
  \xi(\omega) = q_{\omega}
```
takes on the value ``1`` or ``-1`` with equal probability. Here, the first stage contains the two parameters: ``l_1`` and ``u_1``. The second stage contains the three scenario-independent parameters: ``U``, ``l_2``, and ``u_2``. The following defines this problem in StochasticPrograms, with some chosen parameter values:
```@example stage
using StochasticPrograms
using GLPKMathProgInterface

@scenario Simple = begin
    q::Float64
end

ξ₁ = SimpleScenario(1., probability = 0.5)
ξ₂ = SimpleScenario(-1., probability = 0.5)

l₁ = -1.
u₁ = 1.

U = 2.
l₂ = -1.
u₂ = 1.

sp = StochasticProgram((l₁,u₁), (U,l₂,u₂), [ξ₁,ξ₂])

@first_stage sp = begin
    l₁, u₁ = stage
    @variable(model, l₁ <= x <= u₁)
    @objective(model, Max, x)
end

@second_stage sp = begin
    @decision x
    U, l₂, u₂ = stage
    ξ = scenario
    @variable(model, l₂ <= y <= u₂)
    @objective(model, Max, ξ.q*y)
    @constraint(model, y + x <= U)
end

print(sp)

print("VRP = $VRP(sp, solver = GLPKSolverLP())")
```
Now, we can investigate the impact of the stage parameters by changing them slightly and regenerate the problem:
```@example stage
l₁ = -2.
u₁ = 2.

U = 2.
l₂ = -0.5
u₂ = 0.5

set_first_stage_data!(sp, (l₁,u₁))
set_second_stage_data!(sp, (U,l₂,u₂))

generate!(sp) # Regenerate problem

print(sp)

print("VRP = $VRP(sp, solver = GLPKSolverLP())")
```

## Scenario data

Any uncertain parameter in the second stage of a stochastic program should be included in some predefined [`AbstractScenario`](@ref) type. Hence, all uncertain parameters in a stochastic program must be identified before defining the models. In brief, StochasticPrograms demands two functions from this abstraction. The discrete probability of a given [`AbstractScenario`](@ref) occurring should be returned from [`probability`](@ref). Also, the expected scenario out of a collection of given [`AbstractScenario`](@ref)s should be returned by [`expected`](@ref). StochasticPrograms provides a convenience macro, [`@scenario`](@ref), for creating scenario types that adhere to this abstraction. If the identified uncertain parameters is a collection of numerical values, this is the recommended way to define the required scenario type.

```@example
using StochasticPrograms

@scenario Example = begin
    X::Float64
end

s₁ = ExampleScenario(1., probability = 0.5)
s₂ = ExampleScenario(5., probability = 0.5)

println("Probability of s₁: $(probability(s₁))")

s = expected([s₁, s₂])

println("Expectation over s₁ and s₂: $s")
println("Expectated X: $(s.scenario.X)")

```
Here, all the required operations are correctly defined.

There are some caveats to note. First, the autogenerated requires an additive zero element of the introduced scenario type. For simple numeric types this is autogenerated as well. However, say that we want to extend the above scenario with some vector parameter of size 2:
```@example
using StochasticPrograms

@scenario Example = begin
    X::Float64
    Y::Vector{Float64}
end
```
In this case, we must provide an implementation of `zero` using [`@zero`](@ref):
```@example
using StochasticPrograms

@scenario Example = begin
    X::Float64
    Y::Vector{Float64}

    @zero begin
        return Example(0.0, [0.0, 0.0])
    end
end

s₁ = ExampleScenario(1., ones(2), probability = 0.5)
s₂ = ExampleScenario(5., -ones(2), probability = 0.5)

println("Probability of s₁: $(probability(s₁))")

s = expected([s₁, s₂])

println("Expectation over s₁ and s₂: $s")
println("Expectated X: $(s.scenario.X)")
println("Expectated Y: $(s.scenario.Y)")
```
Another caveat is that the [`expected`](@ref) function can only be auto generated for fields that support addition and scalar multiplication with `Float64`. Consider:
```@example
using StochasticPrograms

@scenario Example = begin
    X::Float64
    Y::Vector{Float64}
    Z::Int

    @zero begin
        return Example(0.0, [0.0, 0.0], 0)
    end
end
```
Again, the solution is to provide an implementation of `expected`, this time using [`@expectation`](@ref):
```@example
using StochasticPrograms

@scenario Example = begin
    X::Float64
    Y::Vector{Float64}
    Z::Int

    @zero begin
        return Example(0.0, [0.0, 0.0], 0)
    end

    @expectation begin
        X = sum([probability(s)*s.X for s in scenarios])
        Y = sum([probability(s)*s.Y for s in scenarios])
        Z = sum([round(Int, probability(s)*s.Z) for s in scenarios])
        return Example(X, Y, Z)
    end
end

s₁ = ExampleScenario(1., ones(2), 1, probability = 0.5)
s₂ = ExampleScenario(5., -ones(2), -1, probability = 0.5)

println("Probability of s₁: $(probability(s₁))")

s = expected([s₁, s₂])

println("Expectation over s₁ and s₂: $s")
println("Expectated X: $(s.scenario.X)")
println("Expectated Y: $(s.scenario.Y)")
println("Expectated Z: $(s.scenario.Z)")
```
For most problems, [`@scenario`](@ref) will probably be adequate. Otherwise consider defining [Custom scenarios](@ref).

## Sampling

```@setup sampling
using Random
Random.seed!(1)
```
Typically, we do not have exact knowledge of all possible future scenarios. However, we often have access to some model of the uncertainty. For example, scenarios could originate from:

 - A stochastic variable with known distribution
 - A time series fitted to data
 - A nerual network prediction

Even if the exact scenario distribution is unknown, or not all possible scenarios are available, we can still formulate a stochastic program that approximates the model we wish to formulate. This is achieved through a technique called *sampled average approximation*, which is based on sampling. The idea is to sample a large number ``n`` of scenarios with equal probability ``\frac{1}{n}`` and then use them to generate and solve a stochastic program. By the law of large numbers, the result will converge with probability ``1`` to the "true" solution with increasing ``n``.

StochasticPrograms accepts [`AbstractSampler`](@ref) objects in place of [`AbstractScenario`](@ref). However, an [`AbstractSampler`](@ref) is always linked to some underlying [`AbstractScenario`](@ref) type, which is reflected in the resulting stochastic program as well. Samplers are conviniently created using [`@sampler`](@ref). We can define a simple scenario type and a simple sampler as follows:

```@example sampling
using StochasticPrograms

@scenario Example = begin
    ξ::Float64
end

@sampler Example = begin
    w::Float64

    Example(w::AbstractFloat) = new(w)

    @sample begin
        w = sampler.w
        return ExampleScenario(w*randn(), probability = rand())
    end
end
```
This creates a new [`AbstractSampler`](@ref) type called `ExampleSampler`, which samples `ExampleScenario`s. Now, we can create a sampler object and sample a scenario
```@example sampling
sampler = ExampleSampler(2.)

s = sampler()

println(s)
println("ξ: $(s.ξ)")
```
It is possible to create other sampler objects for the `ExampleScenario`, by providing a new unique name:
```@example sampling
@sampler Another Example = begin
    w::Float64
    d::Float64

    Another(w::AbstractFloat, d::AbstractFloat) = new(w, d)

    @sample begin
        w = sampler.w
        d = sampler.d
        return ExampleScenario(w*randn() + d, probability = rand())
    end
end

another = AnotherSampler(2., 6.)

s = another()

println(s)
println("ξ: $(s.ξ)")
```
Now, lets use the first sampler to create a stochastic program:
```@example sampling
sp = StochasticProgram(sampler)

@first_stage sp = begin
    @variable(model, x >= 0)
    @objective(model, Min, x)
end

@second_stage sp = begin
    @decision x
    ξ = scenario.ξ
    @variable(model, y)
    @objective(model, Min, y)
    @constraint(model, y + x == ξ)
end
```
Now, we can sample ``5`` scenarios to generate ``5`` subproblems:
```@example sampling
sample!(sp, 5)
```
Printing yields:
```@example sampling
print(sp)
```
Sampled stochastic programs are solved as usual:
```@example sampling
using GLPKMathProgInterface

optimize!(sp, solver = GLPKSolverLP())

println("optimal decision: $(optimal_decision(sp))")
println("optimal value: $(optimal_value(sp))")
```
The quality of the model can be checked in different ways. One indicator is:
```@example sampling
VSS(sp, solver = GLPKSolverLP())
```
Another is acquired by evaluating the optimal decision on a larger number of sampled scenarios:
```@example sampling
x = optimal_decision(sp)
sample!(sp, 10000)
evaluate_decision(sp, x, solver = GLPKSolverLP())
```
Again, if the functionality offered by [`@sampler`](@ref) is not adequate, consider [Custom scenarios](@ref).

## Custom scenarios

```@setup custom
using Random
Random.seed!(1)
```

More complex scenario designs are probably not implementable using [`@scenario`](@ref). However, it is still possible to create a custom scenario type as long as:

 - The type is a subtype of [`AbstractScenario`](@ref)
 - The type implements [`probability`](@ref)
 - The type implements [`expected`](@ref), which should return an additive zero element if given an empty array

The restriction on `expected` is there to support taking expectations in a distributed environment.

As an example, consider the following generalized stochastic program:
```math
\DeclareMathOperator*{\minimize}{minimize}
\begin{aligned}
 \minimize_{x \in \mathbb{R}} & \quad \operatorname{\mathbb{E}}_{\omega} \left[(x - \xi(\omega))^2\right] \\
\end{aligned}
```
where ``\xi(\omega)`` is exponentially distributed. We will skip the mathematical details here and just take for granted that the optimizer to the above problem is the mean of the exponential distribution. We will try to approximately solve this problem using sample average approximation. First, lets try to introduce a custom discrete scenario type that models a stochastic variable with a continuous probability distribution. Consider the following implementation:
```@example custom
using StochasticPrograms
using Distributions

struct DistributionScenario{D <: UnivariateDistribution} <: AbstractScenario
    probability::Probability
    distribution::D
    ξ::Float64

    function DistributionScenario(distribution::UnivariateDistribution, val::AbstractFloat)
        return new{typeof(distribution)}(Probability(pdf(distribution, val)), distribution, Float64(val))
    end
end

function StochasticPrograms.expected(scenarios::Vector{<:DistributionScenario{D}}) where D <: UnivariateDistribution
    isempty(scenarios) && return DistributionScenario(D(), 0.0)
    distribution = scenarios[1].distribution
    return ExpectedScenario(DistributionScenario(distribution, mean(distribution)))
end
```
The fallback [`probability`](@ref) method is viable as long as the scenario type contains a [`Probability`](@ref) field named `probability`. The implementation of [`expected`](@ref) is somewhat unconventional as it returns the mean of the distribution regardless of how many scenarios are given.

We are also free to define custom sampler objects, as long as:

 - The sampler type is a subtype of [`AbstractSampler`](@ref)
 - The sampler type implements a functor call that performs the sampling

We can implement a sampler that generates exponentially distributed scenarios as follows:
```@example custom
struct ExponentialSampler <: AbstractSampler{DistributionScenario{Exponential{Float64}}}
    distribution::Exponential

    ExponentialSampler(θ::AbstractFloat) = new(Exponential(θ))
end

function (sampler::ExponentialSampler)()
    ξ = rand(sampler.distribution)
    return DistributionScenario(sampler.distribution, ξ)
end
```
Now, lets attempt to define the generalized stochastic program using the available modeling tools:
```@example custom
using Ipopt

sampler = ExponentialSampler(2.)
sp = StochasticProgram(sampler)

@first_stage sp = begin
    @variable(model, x)
end

@second_stage sp = begin
    @decision x
    ξ = scenario.ξ
    @variable(model, y)
    @constraint(model, y == (x - ξ)^2)
    @objective(model, Min, y)
end
```
The mean of the given exponential distribution is ``2.0``, which is the optimal solution to the general problem. Now, lets sample 1000 exponentially distributed numbers with equal probability:
```@example custom
StochasticPrograms.sample!(sp, 1000) # Sample 1000 exponentially distributed scenarios (qualified call due to name clash with Distributions.jl)
```
By the law of large numbers, we approach the generalized formulation with increasing sample size. Solving yields:
```@example custom
optimize!(sp, solver = IpoptSolver(print_level=0))

println("Optimal decision: $(optimal_decision(sp))")
println("Optimal value: $(optimal_value(sp))")
```
Now, due to the special implementation of the [`expected`](@ref) function, it actually holds that the expected value solution solves the generalized problem. Consider:
```@example custom
println("EVP decision: $(EVP_decision(sp, solver = IpoptSolver(print_level=0)))")
println("VSS: $(VSS(sp, solver = IpoptSolver(print_level=0)))")
```
Accordingly, the VSS is small.
